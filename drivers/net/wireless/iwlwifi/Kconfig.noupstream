	help
	  Enable this option if your base kernel has broken PCI(e)
	  suspend/resume code and the driver has to work around it
	  or if you need the driver to store and restore the PCIe
	  configuration for other reasons.

config IWLWIFI_INTEGRATE_SUSPEND_RESUME
	bool "integrate suspend/resume into the driver"
	depends on IWLMVM && PM_SLEEP
	help
	  Enable this option if for some reason you cannot rely on
	  the kernel calling the wiphy's suspend/resume function at
	  the right place. Don't enable this unless you need it.

config IWLWIFI_MVM_RFKILL_ON_SUSPEND
	bool "pretend device is in RF-kill during suspend"
	depends on IWLMVM && IWLWIFI_PCIE
	select IWLWIFI_INTEGRATE_SUSPEND_RESUME
	help
	  Enable this option if for some reason you require the
	  device to pretend it's in RF-kill while suspended. This
	  should normally not be necessary.

	  Note that selecting this option will disable WoWLAN and
	  actually remove the feature completely.

config IWLWIFI_MINI_PM_RUNTIME
	bool "internal mini-runtime PM implementation"
	depends on IWLWIFI
	depends on !PM_RUNTIME
	help
	  Enable use of an internal reference counting framework for the
	  purpose of getting the FW and bus into a low power state when
	  the WiFi component is idle.
